        TN Champions Foundation offers you access to its interactive online
        website, applications and services. This Privacy Policy explains what
        information may be collected when you access our Portal (“portal”), how
        we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose
        the information to third parties. Depending on your activities when
        using or accessing our Portal or Applications (collectively,
        “Services”), you may from time-to-time be required to agree to
        additional terms and conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that this Privacy Policy applies regardless of whether you
        use our Services via a computer, mobile device or other platform
        (collectively, your “Equipment”). Also, this Privacy Policy applies only
        to information we collect through our Services and does not apply to our
        collection of information from other sources (e.g., in person, over the
        telephone, etc.).
      </p>
      <h4>Modifications to This Privacy Policy</h4>
      <p>
        We generally keep this Privacy Policy posted on our TN Champions
        Foundation Portal. You should review this Privacy Policy frequently, as
        it may change from time to time without notice. Any changes will be
        effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy.
        WHEN YOU USE OUR SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO
        NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, OR TO ANY CHANGES WE MAY SUBSEQUENTLY
        MAKE, IMMEDIATELY STOP USING OUR SERVICES. Please note, however, that if
        we decide to use your personally identifiable information in a manner
        materially different than what is provided in this Privacy Policy or
        what we advised at the time it was collected, we will notify you of this
        change by e-mail to the last e-mail address provided to us or through
        our Applications. You will have a choice (by means of an “opt out”
        opportunity) as to whether or not we use their information in this
        different manner. In such case, we will use your personally identifiable
        information in accordance with the terms in place when the information
        was collected.
      </p>
      <h4>Information We Collect</h4>
      <p>
        We typically collect two kinds of information about you when you use our
        Services:
      </p>
      <p>
        (a) information that you provide that personally identifies you and (b)
        information that does not personally identify you that we automatically
        collect or that you provide us. Personally Identifiable Information: Our
        definition of personally identifiable information includes any
        information that may be used to specifically identify or contact you,
        such as your name, mail address, phone number, etc. As a general policy,
        we do not automatically collect your personally identifiable information
        when you visit our Website. In certain circumstances, we may request,
        allow or otherwise provide you an opportunity to submit your personally
        identifiable information in connection with a feature, program,
        promotion or some other aspect of our Services. For instance, you may:
        (a) provide your name, email address, phone number and Pan Card details
        when registering or in connection with a contribution made or (b) post a
        general comment and/or recommendation on our Portal
      </p>
      <p>
        Non-Personally Identifiable Information: Our definition of
        non-personally identifiable information is any information that does not
        personally identify you. Non-personally identifiable information can
        include certain personally identifiable information that has been
        de-identified; that is, information that has been rendered anonymous. We
        obtain non- personally identifiable information about you from
        information that you provide us, either separately or together with your
        personally identifiable information. We also automatically collect
        certain non-personally identifiable information from you when you
        access/ use our Services through your Equipment. This information can
        include, among other things, your mobile device, wireless carrier, IP
        addresses, the type of browser you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer,
        Firefox, Safari, Opera, etc.), the third party website from which your
        visit originated, the operating system you are using (e.g., Vista,
        Windows XP, Mac OS, Android, iPhone, etc.), the domain name of your
        Internet service provider (e.g., Airtel, Reliance, BSNL, etc.), the
        search terms you use; and how much you use our Services
      </p>
      <h4>How We Use & Share the Information Collected</h4>
      <p>
        Personally Identifiable Information: The personally identifiable
        information you submit to us is generally used to carry out your
        requests, respond to your inquiries, better assist you, or in other ways
        naturally associated with the circumstances in which you provided the
        information.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, we may share your personally identifiable information with
        participating sponsors to a program or promotion (e.g., a contest) you
        enter via our Services. Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, our
        Terms of Use, or as set forth when you submit the information, your
        personally identifiable information will not be shared or sold to any
        third parties without your prior approval.
      </p>
      <p>
        Non-Personally Identifiable Information: We use non-personally
        identifiable information in a variety of ways. For example, we may use
        non-personally identifiable information to evaluate use of our Services
        (e.g., visits to our Portal, use of our Applications, etc.), understand
        partner needs and trends, carry out targeted alumni promotion
        activities, and to improve our services. We may use your non-personally
        identifiable information by itself or aggregate it with information we
        have obtained from other partners or other sources.
      </p>
      <h5>Other Uses & Information</h5>
      <p>
        IP Addresses: An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned
        to your Equipment whenever you access the Internet. Web servers
        (computers that “serve up” web pages) automatically identify your
        Equipment by its IP address. When visitors request pages from our
        Website, our servers typically log their IP addresses. We collect IP
        addresses for purposes of system administration, to report non-personal
        aggregate information to others, and to track the use of our Services.
        IP addresses are considered non-personally identifiable information and
        may also be shared as provided above. It is not our practice to link IP
        addresses to anything personally identifiable; that is, the visitor’s
        session will be logged, but the visitor remains anonymous to us.
        However, we reserve the right to use IP addresses to identify a visitor
        at the request of the visitor or when we feel it is necessary to enforce
        compliance with our Service rules or to: (a) fulfil a Government
        request; (b) conform with the requirements of the law or legal process;
        (c) protect or defend our legal rights or property, our Services, or
        other users; or (d) in an emergency to protect the health and safety of
        our partners or the general public.
      </p>
      <p>
        Email Communications: If you send us an email with questions or
        comments, we may use your personally identifiable information to respond
        to your questions or comments, and we may save your questions or
        comments for future reference. For security reasons, we do not recommend
        that you send non-public personal information, such as passwords, social
        security numbers, or bank account information, to us by email. In
        certain instances, we may provide you with the option to set your
        preferences for receiving email communications from us; that is, agree
        to some communications but not others. You may “opt out” of receiving
        future commercial email communications from us by clicking the
        “unsubscribe” link included at the bottom of most emails we send, or as
        provided below; provided, however, we reserve the right to send you
        transnational emails such as partnership communications
      </p>
      <p>
        Other: Regardless of any other provision in this Privacy Policy, we
        reserve the right to disclose any personally identifiable or
        non-personally identifiable information about you if we are required to
        do so by law, with respect to copyright and other intellectual property
        infringement claims, or if we believe that such action is necessary to:
        (a) fulfil a Government request; (b) conform with the requirements of
        the law or legal process; (c) protect or defend our legal rights or
        property, our Services, or other users; or (d) in an emergency to
        protect the health and safety of our partners or the general public
      </p>
      <h4>Public Forums</h4>
      <p>
        We may offer chat rooms, blogs, message boards, bulletin boards, or
        similar public forums where you and other users of our Services can
        communicate. The protections described in this Privacy Policy do not
        apply when you provide information (including personal information) in
        connection with your use of these public forums. We may use personally
        identifiable and non-personally identifiable information about you to
        identify you with a posting in a public forum. Any information you share
        in a public forum is public information and may be seen or collected by
        anyone, including third parties that do not adhere to our Privacy
        Policy. We are not responsible for events arising from the distribution
        of any information you choose to publicly post or share through our
        Services
      </p>
      <h4>Keeping Your Information Secure</h4>
      <p>
        We have implemented security measures we consider reasonable and
        appropriate to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the
        information under our control. Please be advised, however, that while we
        strive to protect your personally identifiable information and privacy,
        we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you
        disclose or transmit to us online or through our Services, and are not
        responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of
        your personally identifiable information. In the unfortunate event that
        your “personally identifiable information” (as the term or similar terms
        are defined by any applicable law requiring notice upon a security
        breach) is compromised, we may notify you by e-mail (at our sole and
        absolute discretion) to the last e-mail address you have provided us in
        the most expedient time reasonable under the circumstances; provided,
        however, delays in notification may occur while we take necessary
        measures to determine the scope of the breach and restore reasonable
        integrity to the system as well as for the legitimate needs of law
        enforcement if notification would impede a criminal investigation. From
        time to time we evaluate new technology for protecting information, and
        when appropriate, we upgrade our information security systems.
      </p>
      <h4>Other Sites/Links</h4>
      <p>
        Our Services may link to or contain links to other third party websites
        that we do not control or maintain, we may recommend or reference via
        our Services you may see while using our Services. We are not
        responsible for the privacy practices employed by any third party
        website. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of all third
        party websites before submitting any personally identifiable information
        through these websites
      </p>
      <h4>Contact & Opt-Out Information</h4>
      <p>
        You may contact us as at if: (a) you have questions or comments about
        our Privacy Policy; (b) wish to make corrections to any personally
        identifiable information you have provided; (c) want to opt-out from
        receiving future correspondence, including emails, from us or our
        affiliated partners; or (d) wish to withdraw your consent to sharing
        your personally identifiable information with others.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will make best effort to respond to your request and, if applicable
        and appropriate, make the requested change in our active databases as
        soon as reasonably practicable. Please note that we may not be able to
        fulfil certain requests while allowing you access to certain features of
        our Website.
      </p>

        summary, modification, restatement or other version thereof, or other
        privacy statement or policy, in any form, is valid unless we post a new
        or revised policy to the TN Champions Portal.
